<h1 style="color:Gold; font-size:40px; text-align:center;"> <b> <u> IMAM AL-SHAFI'I </u> </b> </h1> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size:25px; text-align:center;"> <b> Imam Al-Shafi'i, also known as Shaykh Al Islam 
is one of the four great Imams of Sunni Schools of law.<br>
His full name is Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Idris Al'Shafi'i ibn Al-Abbas ibn Uthman ibn Syafie bin Ubaid bin Abdu Yazid ibn Hashim ibn Al-Muttalib 
[Father of Abdul Muttalib who is the grandfather of the Prophet Muhammad S.A.W] ibn Abd Manaf. <br>
He is the only Imam who is related to Prophet Muhammad(PBUH) as he belonged to Qurayshi tribe of Banu Hashim(The tribe of Prophet Muhammad(PBUH).
</b> </p> <br>


<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 25px;"> Imam Al-Shafi'i was born in the year 150 AH(After Hijrat) in Ghaza, Palestine. It was the same year in which the Great 
Imam Abu Hanifah had passed away. He lost his father during infancy and was raised by his mother under very poor circumstances. <br>
He was 2 years old when his mother migrated to Makkah. Therefore, he spent his formative years acquiring religious education in the cities of Makkah and Madina. 
He memorized Quran by the age of 7. His early education was marked by poverty because of which his mother could not afford to pay the fees for his education.<br>
He became so adept at learning and storing knowledge even though just by listening, that on occasions when his teacher was unable to take a class, he the young Imam 
would step in and take the class, teaching his fellow students.
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 25px;"> At the age of 13, after his memorization of the Holy Quran and Hadith, <br>
his mother decided to send him to Imam Malik to learn his adab. She wrote a letter to the Governor of Makkah to send a letter to the Governor of Madina 
to go with Imam Shafi'i and to intercede for him to become his teacher. They went to the house of Imam Malik and Imam Shafi'i says to the Imam Malik, <br>
"I memorized the Holy Quran at the age of 7 and your muwatta's at the of 10. My mother has send me to learn from you" <br>
Imam Malik replied, <br>
"My son! By the will of Allah, you will have a great future. Tomorrow come to me and bring with you someone who could read the 'Muwatta' well as i fear you 
would not be able to read it by yourself.<br>
Imam Al-Shafi'i responded with the same politeness, <br>
"Imam Malik, I will read it myself from the memory without a book."
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 25px; text-align:center;"> <b> For a period of 9 years, Imam Al-Shafi'i remained in Madina until Imam Malik passed away in the 
year 179 AH(After Hijrat).<br>
After the death of Imam Malik, Imam Shafi'i returned to Makkah with a great load of knowledge which had influenced his life!
</b> </p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 25px; text-align:center;"> Imam Al-Shafi'i learned from the scholars in various places such as Makkah, Madina, Kufa, Basrah, Yemen, Syria, 
and Egypt.<br>

Imam Malik bin Anas (In Madina) <br>
Wakee bin Al-Jaraah bin Maleeh Al-Kofi (In Kufa) <br>

6. He also met Imam Ahmed ibn Hanbal and took mutual knowledge between the two.<br>

</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 25px;"> The Governor of Yemen, while paying a visit to Makkah, met Imam Al-Shafi'i, discerned at his unique abilities, he offered him 
an administrative post in Yemen but like his predecessor Imam Abu Hanifa, Imam Shafi'i also suffered political persecution and intrigues, but thankfully, 
unlike Imam Abu Hanifa, he was not subjected to torture.<br>
Imam Al-Shafi'i was arrested and charged with the offense of political interference in Yemen. <br> 
The Caliph of that time, Haroon Al-Rashid examined him and found him to be innocent of all the charges and discharged him with Honour.
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 25px;"> The students of Imam Malik became extreme in following Imam Malik.<br>
After he passed away, Imam Shafi'i found that the people would say[The Prophet said] and the others would say [Imam Malik said].<br>
Imam Al-Shafi'i came up with a book and he wrote evidences against some of the errors of his teachers. because of these matters, the students of Imam Malik 
hated him. They hated him a lot and they waited for him when he was delivering a dars in the Masjid in yemen. They entered upon him and after he finished his lesson, 
they attacked him until he became unconcious. He passed away few days later, not because of the wounds, but because he had an illness.
When he got beaten up, it exasperated and made it worse and he died. <br>
It was Jumu'ah(Friday) on the day he left this world in the Islamic Calendar month of Rajab aged 54 in the year 204 AH(After Hijrat) in Yemen.
